[Haunted Refacatorium](https://github.com/beatrix-chan/haunted-refacatorium) is a web app that haunts legacy repos to reveal cursed code and guide their resurrection into modern architectures.

This project is **vibe-coded** using [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) &mdash; an Agentic AI that allows development from prototype to production, built by Amazon Web Service (AWS) &mdash; for participation in [Kiroween 2025 Hackathon](https://kiroween.devpost.com/). For details how Kiro is used (the write up), please read [kiro-dev.md](kiro-dev.md)
