[Haunted Refacatorium](https://github.com/beatrix-chan/haunted-refacatorium) is a web app that haunts legacy repos to reveal cursed code and guide their resurrection into modern architectures.

This project is **vibe-coded** using [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) &mdash; an Agentic AI that allows development from prototype to production, built by Amazon Web Service (AWS) &mdash; for participation in [Kiroween 2025 Hackathon](https://kiroween.devpost.com/). For details how Kiro is used (the write up), please read [kiro-dev.md](kiro-dev.md).

## Project Details

Haunted Refacatorium is a web app that "haunts" odd or unfashionable tech (e.g., jQuery apps, PHP monoliths, outdated REST APIs, etc.) and guides users through modernizing them into a fresh stack.

This submission is aiming for the category **Resurrection** (dead/obsolete tech &rarr; modern implementation). And bonus submission for **Costume Contest** for the strong spooky theming in the UI and UX.
